# GOAL 1:

## form

- B A B' -> C B C' -> D C D' -> etc
- each part (between two ->) can be marked for a soloist to improvise over

## instrumentation / synths

- soloist 1 (sine)
- soloist 2 (triangle)
- melody (simple violin / flute)
- chord pad (sweeping violinesque)
- bass (square)
- drum beat (hi-hat, kick, snare)

## arrangement

- tempo changes
- velocity changes
- dissonance factor (may impact chord-selection/-progression, scales, melodic-/harmonic- intervals, etc)

## chord

- substituted chords
- leading chords
- basic cadences

## beats

- straight 4/4
- straight 8/8
- straight 6/4
- samba 4/4
- syncopated 8ths

## rhythm

- rhythmic emphasis calculation
- leading
- silly embellishments (like "x---" becoming "xxx-" or "x--x" )

## color

- variable velocity
- slide

## melody

- tonal emphasis calculation
- leading into a note
- silly embellishments (like "C" becoming "C-D-C-B-C" )

## harmony / voice leading

1. Move each voice the shortest distance possible.
    1. When a chord contains one or more notes that will be reused in the chords immediately following, then these notes should remain, that is retained in the respective parts.
    2. The parts which do not remain, follow the law of the shortest way (Gesetze des n√§chsten Weges), that is that each such part names the note of the following chord closest to itself if no forbidden succession arises from this.
    3. If no note at all is present in a chord which can be reused in the chord immediately following, one must apply contrary motion according to the law of the shortest way, that is, if the root progresses upwards, the accompanying parts must move downwards, or inversely, if the root progresses downwards, the other parts move upwards and, in both cases, to the note of the following chord closest to them.
2. Voice crossing should be avoided except to create melodic interest.
3. Avoid parallel fifths and octaves. To promote voice independence, melodic lines should avoid parallel unisons, parallel fifths, and parallel octaves between any two voices. They should also avoid hidden consecutives, perfect intervals reached by any two voices moving in the same direction, even if not by the same interval, particularly if the higher of the two voices makes a disjunct motion.
